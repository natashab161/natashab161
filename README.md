# Hey I'm Natasha ðŸ‘¾

For me software engineering is an extension of my creative career, as I have a background in visual arts production with a deep passion for designing memoriable interactive experiences. I'm particularly interested in creative technologies that promote human expression and encourage engagement with the real world.
